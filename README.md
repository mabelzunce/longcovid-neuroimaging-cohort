# Long COVID Neuroimaging Cohort

This repository contains selected code, documentation, and derived data analysis related to the Long COVID Neuroimaging Cohort — a multimodal study carried out at Universidad Nacional de San Martín (UNSAM), Buenos Aires, Argentina.

The project investigates the long-term neurological and cognitive effects of Long COVID using:

- **Neuroimaging** (structural MRI, ASL, fMRI)
- **Saliva biomarkers** of stress and inflammation (IL-6, M6a, BDNF)
- **Mental health scales** (PHQ-9, GAD-7)
- **Cognitive assessments**
- **Clinical and quality-of-life data**

Data collection has been supported in part by the Ministerio de Producción, Ciencia e Innovación Tecnológica International de la provincia de Buenos Aires and the Brain Research Organization (IBRO).

## Project Overview

- **Participants**: ~200 Long COVID patients and healthy controls, recruited between 2023 and 2024
- **Neuroimaging**: T1-weighted MRI, ASL perfusion imaging, functional MRI, PET in selected cases
- **Biomarkers**: saliva markers (IL-6, M6a, BDNF), clinical metadata
- **Cognition & Mental Health**: validated scales and neuropsychological testing
- **Demographics and HRQoL scales**: validated scales

This cohort builds on our initial work published in BMC Neurology and is being extended through additional funding and collaborations.
